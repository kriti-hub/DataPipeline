## 2. Use Case Prioritization Framework

Three candidate use cases were evaluated for this POC. A weighted scoring model was used to select the single highest-impact use case that demonstrates the most relevant skills for the WellNow Senior Analyst role while addressing TAG's most pressing business needs.

### Candidate Use Cases

| # | Use Case | Description |
|---|---|---|
| UC-1 | Multi-Brand Clinician Retention & Attrition Intelligence | Cross-brand view of where TAG is losing talent, why, and whether TAG University programs are driving retention |
| UC-2 | Multi-Location Workforce Staffing & Coverage Optimization | Location-level staffing efficiency, coverage gaps, overtime hotspots, and float clinician deployment for WellNow |
| UC-3 | Compensation Competitiveness & Pay Equity Analytics | Enterprise-wide compa-ratio analysis across 5 brands and 48 states, gender pay equity, cost-to-market modeling |

### Scoring Criteria

Two primary factors were evaluated, each with sub-dimensions weighted by relevance to the WellNow Senior Analyst role and TAG's stated strategic priorities.

---

### Factor 1: Importance to Customer (Patient) Needs

The healthcare business exists to serve patients. The use case that most directly connects workforce data to patient experience outcomes earns the highest score.

| Sub-Dimension | Weight | UC-1 (Retention) | UC-2 (Staffing) | UC-3 (Comp) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Patient wait times** — Does the analysis directly reduce patient wait times? | 25% | Indirect. Lower turnover means more experienced staff, but the linkage to wait times is second-order. | **Direct.** Coverage gap analysis identifies understaffed shifts that cause long wait times. Float deployment recommendations reduce gaps in real-time. | None. Compensation analysis does not affect day-to-day patient wait times. |
| **Chair/room utilization** — Does the analysis improve how efficiently clinical capacity is used? | 25% | Indirect. Retention keeps chairs filled longer-term, but doesn't optimize daily utilization. | **Direct.** Staff-to-patient ratio analysis and shift-level coverage scoring measure exactly whether clinical capacity is being utilized or wasted. | None. |
| **Profitability per location** — Does the analysis help leadership understand and improve per-location economics? | 25% | Indirect. Retention reduces replacement costs (~213% of salary per exit), but the per-location P&L linkage is diffuse. | **Direct.** Labor cost per patient visit, overtime spend, and coverage efficiency are the primary levers of per-location profitability. Labor is the single largest variable expense for healthcare organizations. | Moderate. Compensation optimization affects cost structure, but at an enterprise level rather than per-location. |
| **Service continuity** — Does the analysis prevent disruptions to patient care delivery? | 25% | Moderate. Reducing attrition prevents long-term staffing holes, but doesn't address day-to-day coverage. | **Direct.** Shift gap detection and callout tracking directly prevent same-day and same-week care delivery disruptions. | None. |

**Factor 1 Scores:**

| Use Case | Score (0–5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| UC-1 (Retention) | 2.5 | Important but indirect — affects patient experience through second-order workforce stability effects |
| **UC-2 (Staffing)** | **4.8** | **Directly connects workforce data to the patient-facing metrics that matter most: wait times, utilization, cost, and continuity** |
| UC-3 (Comp) | 1.5 | Primarily an internal HR/Finance concern — minimal direct patient impact |

---

### Factor 2: Alignment with Business Growth (ROI)

TAG grew revenue 8% YoY in H1 2025 while expanding to 1,429 locations. Growth at this scale requires operational efficiency — not just adding locations, but making each location perform better with existing resources.

#### Sub-Dimension 2A: Improving Employee Utilization — Reducing Overwork & Promoting Work-Life Balance

| Use Case | Impact | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| UC-1 (Retention) | Moderate | Identifies that burnout-driven attrition is happening, but doesn't show *where* overwork is occurring at a shift or location level. |
| **UC-2 (Staffing)** | **High** | Overtime tracking, callout pattern analysis, and coverage scoring directly identify which locations and shifts are overworking staff. Data-driven float deployment redistributes workload, reducing burnout at the source. When a clinic is chronically understaffed, it's not just a cost problem — it's the #1 driver of clinician burnout, which the AHA calls healthcare's top workforce challenge. This analysis gives operations the data to fix it. |
| UC-3 (Comp) | Low | Compensation adjustments don't address workload distribution. A well-paid clinician working 60-hour weeks due to understaffing still burns out. |

#### Sub-Dimension 2B: Improving Revenue per Clinician and Staff Member

| Use Case | Impact | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| UC-1 (Retention) | Moderate | Retaining experienced clinicians is important (they see more patients per hour), but this is a long-cycle metric. |
| **UC-2 (Staffing)** | **High** | Patients-per-provider-hour is a direct measure of revenue productivity. Coverage optimization ensures clinicians are deployed where patient demand exists — not sitting idle at overstaffed locations while another clinic turns patients away. Every unfilled shift gap at a WellNow clinic represents lost walk-in revenue that can *never* be recaptured (unlike dental, where appointments can be rescheduled). The analysis also identifies whether support staff ratios are enabling or constraining clinician productivity. |
| UC-3 (Comp) | Low-Moderate | Market-competitive compensation can reduce recruiting cycle times, getting clinicians into productive roles faster, but doesn't directly improve per-clinician revenue. |

**Factor 2 Scores:**

| Use Case | Score (0–5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| UC-1 (Retention) | 3.0 | Valuable but addresses symptoms (attrition) more than root causes (workload imbalance) |
| **UC-2 (Staffing)** | **4.7** | **Directly improves both employee well-being (reducing overwork) and revenue generation (optimizing deployment). Addresses the root cause that drives both burnout and lost revenue.** |
| UC-3 (Comp) | 2.0 | Important for long-term talent strategy but limited short-term ROI on revenue or utilization |

---

### Final Prioritization Matrix

| Use Case | Factor 1: Customer Needs (50%) | Factor 2: Business Growth ROI (50%) | **Weighted Score** | **Rank** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UC-1: Clinician Retention | 2.5 | 3.0 | **2.75** | 2nd |
| **UC-2: Staffing Optimization** | **4.8** | **4.7** | **4.75** | **1st ✓** |
| UC-3: Compensation Analytics | 1.5 | 2.0 | **1.75** | 3rd |

### Decision

**Use Case 2 — Multi-Location Workforce Staffing & Coverage Optimization** is selected as the sole focus of this POC because:

1. **It directly impacts patient experience** — the metric TAG's business model depends on. Walk-in urgent care lives and dies on wait times and availability.
2. **It addresses both sides of the ROI equation** — reducing waste (overtime, overstaffing) while increasing revenue (filling coverage gaps where patient demand exists).
3. **It demonstrates the deepest range of analytical skills** — combining HRIS data, scheduling data, and patient volume data into operational intelligence.
4. **It is the most relevant to the WellNow Senior Analyst role** — the job description emphasizes working with WellNow field teams, understanding cross-departmental business impact, and building enterprise-wide reporting.
5. **It solves healthcare's #1 challenge** — workforce shortages and burnout — with data, not guesswork.

---

## 3. Use Case: Multi-Location Workforce Staffing & Coverage Optimization

### Business Problem

WellNow Urgent Care operates walk-in clinics across multiple states where **patient demand is variable and unpredictable** — driven by flu season, weather events, local outbreaks, and day-of-week patterns. Unlike scheduled dental appointments, urgent care requires real-time staffing adequacy. Every hour a clinic is understaffed means longer wait times, patient walkaways, and lost revenue. Every hour it's overstaffed means wasted labor dollars — the single largest variable expense for healthcare organizations.

TAG's field operations leaders need a data-driven view of **staffing efficiency across locations**: Which clinics are consistently understaffed? Which are overstaffed? Where are shift gaps creating coverage risks? How should float/PRN clinicians be deployed across a region?

This use case directly maps to the WellNow Senior Analyst role requirements:
- *"Working across departments to understand how their work impacts the performance of the business"*
- *"Combining multiple data sources; strong attention to detail and data integrity"*
- *"Synthesizing insights from various data sources and presenting data in an easy-to-read manner"*
- *"Utilizing data to uncover trends and insights, connecting changes in operational metrics to broader business performance"*

### Stakeholder Map

| Stakeholder | Seniority | What They Need | How They Use It |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WellNow Brand President** | Executive | Regional staffing efficiency scorecard | Weekly executive review — deciding where to invest in new hires vs. redistribute |
| **VP of Operations** | Senior Leadership | Location-level staff-to-patient ratio trends, coverage gap alerts | Operational reviews — holding regional directors accountable for staffing KPIs |
| **Regional Directors** | Mid-Management | Weekly staffing optimization recommendations | Tactical — deploying float clinicians, adjusting shift schedules |
| **Finance / FP&A** | Senior Leadership | Labor cost per patient visit by location, overtime trend analysis | Budget planning — forecasting labor spend, identifying cost reduction opportunities |
| **Recruiting / TA** | Mid-Management | Priority hiring locations based on chronic understaffing patterns | Hiring pipeline prioritization — where to focus sourcing efforts |
| **Clinic Office Managers** | Frontline | Their location's staffing scorecard vs. regional benchmarks | Self-service — understanding how their clinic performs relative to peers |

### Key Metrics & KPIs

| KPI | Definition | Target | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Coverage Score** | actual_provider_hours / required_provider_hours | 0.95–1.10 | Below 0.85 = patient wait times spike; above 1.15 = labor waste |
| **Patients per Provider Hour** | total_patient_visits / actual_provider_hours | ≥ 2.5 | Core productivity metric — revenue is directly proportional |
| **Labor Cost per Visit** | total_labor_cost / total_patient_visits | ≤ regional benchmark | Profitability driver — the primary variable cost per patient encounter |
| **Overtime Rate** | overtime_hours / total_hours_worked | ≤ 8% | Indicator of chronic understaffing; also burnout risk signal |
| **Shift Gap Frequency** | shifts_with_gap / total_shifts | ≤ 10% | Availability risk — how often patients arrive to understaffed clinics |
| **Callout Rate** | callout_count / scheduled_shifts | ≤ 5% | Leading indicator of morale issues and impending coverage problems |
| **Avg Wait Time** | avg_wait_time_minutes per location | ≤ 25 min | Patient satisfaction proxy — directly affects NPS and return visits |
| **Fill Rate** | filled_budgeted_positions / total_budgeted_positions | ≥ 90% | Structural staffing health — are we keeping up with headcount targets? |

---

## 5. Simulated HRIS API Specification

**Purpose:** Mimic workforce and operational data sources that would exist in TAG's real environment (Workday HRIS, scheduling/timekeeping system, patient volume reporting). Returns realistic multi-location urgent care staffing data.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Faker, Docker

### Endpoints

```
GET  /api/v1/workers
     → Paginated employee/clinician records
     Query params: ?page=1&page_size=100&location_id=LOC-042&role_type=Provider

GET  /api/v1/workers/{employee_id}
     → Single employee detail

GET  /api/v1/schedules
     → Scheduled and actual shift data by location and date range
     Query params: ?start_date=2026-01-01&end_date=2026-01-31&location_id=LOC-042

GET  /api/v1/patient-volume
     → Daily patient visit counts by location
     Query params: ?start_date=2026-01-01&end_date=2026-01-31&location_id=LOC-042

GET  /api/v1/locations
     → Location master data (all WellNow clinics)

GET  /api/v1/terminations
     → Termination records within a date range
     Query params: ?start_date=2025-01-01&end_date=2026-01-31

GET  /health
     → Health check / readiness probe
```

### Data Generation Requirements

- **Organization modeled:** ~80 urgent care clinic locations across 15 states, ~1,200 employees
- **Role types:** Provider (MD/DO/PA/NP), RN, Medical Assistant, Radiology Tech, Office Manager, Front Desk
- **Referential integrity:** Every employee → valid location; every manager_id → valid employee
- **Realistic distributions:**
  - ~22% annual attrition for support staff, ~12% for providers
  - Seasonal patient volume (higher in winter/flu season, lower in summer)
  - Day-of-week demand patterns (Monday and weekend peaks for urgent care)
  - Urban locations higher volume than rural; staffing ratios vary accordingly
  - 5–8% callout rate; overtime concentrated at understaffed locations
- **Historical depth:** 18 months of daily scheduling and patient volume data
- **Seed-based reproducibility:** Deterministic output for consistent demo and testing

### Authentication

API key via `X-API-Key` header (simulates enterprise API auth pattern). Key stored in environment variable, validated on every request.

---

## 6. ETL Pipeline Specification

**Purpose:** Production-grade ETL that extracts from the HRIS API, validates data quality, transforms into analytics-ready models, and loads into BigQuery.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, pandas, google-cloud-bigquery, google-cloud-storage, requests, pydantic

### Stage 1: Extract

```python
"""
Responsibilities:
- Authenticate with HRIS API using API key
- Paginate through all endpoints with configurable page_size
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting (max 3 retries)
- Handle API errors gracefully (timeouts, 5xx, malformed responses)
- Stage raw JSON responses to Cloud Storage as timestamped files
  Pattern: gs://{bucket}/raw/{endpoint}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{timestamp}.json
- Log extraction metrics: records_fetched, duration_ms, errors, bytes
- Support both full and incremental extraction modes
"""
```

### Stage 2: Validate

```python
"""
Responsibilities:
- Schema validation using Pydantic models (strict mode)
- Execute all 15 data quality rules (see Section 8)
- Null checks on required fields
- Referential integrity checks (location_key exists, manager_id valid)
- Range validation (hours >= 0, patient_visits >= 0, coverage_score reasonable)
- Duplicate detection (composite key uniqueness)
- Flag but DO NOT drop invalid records → route to _quarantine table
- Generate structured DQ report: pass/fail counts per rule, per table
- Write results to _data_quality_log table in BigQuery
"""
```

### Stage 3: Transform

```python
"""
Responsibilities:
- Flatten nested JSON into tabular format
- Derive calculated fields:
    - coverage_score = actual_provider_hours / required_provider_hours
    - patients_per_provider_hour = patient_visits / actual_provider_hours
    - labor_cost_per_visit = total_labor_cost / patient_visits
    - overtime_rate = overtime_hours / total_hours_worked
    - gap_flag = TRUE when actual_providers < required_providers
    - excess_flag = TRUE when actual_providers > required_providers * 1.15
    - staffing_classification (Chronically Understaffed / Needs Attention /
      Optimally Staffed / Potentially Overstaffed) based on rolling coverage
    - tenure_band (0-1yr, 1-3yr, 3-5yr, 5-10yr, 10+yr)
    - is_new_hire (hired within last 90 days)
- Standardize fields (title case names, ISO dates, consistent enums)
- Build SCD Type 2 history for dim_employee (job/location changes)
- Aggregate shift-level data into fact_daily_staffing
- Detect shift gaps and populate fact_shift_gap
"""
```

### Stage 4: Load

```python
"""
Responsibilities:
- Write to BigQuery using load jobs (not streaming — cost optimization)
- WRITE_TRUNCATE for dimension tables (full refresh)
- WRITE_APPEND for fact tables (incremental)
- Partition fact tables by date for query performance and cost
- Cluster dimension tables by location and role_type
- Update _pipeline_runs metadata table
- Export dashboard-ready JSON to Cloud Storage (Option C for dashboard)
- Log load metrics: rows_loaded, duration, bytes_written
"""
```

## 8. Data Quality Framework

### Validation Rules

| Rule ID | Check Type | Table | Rule | Severity | Action on Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DQ-001 | Null Check | dim_employee | employee_id IS NOT NULL | Critical | Quarantine record |
| DQ-002 | Null Check | dim_employee | hire_date IS NOT NULL | Critical | Quarantine record |
| DQ-003 | Null Check | dim_employee | role_type IS NOT NULL | Critical | Quarantine record |
| DQ-004 | Uniqueness | dim_employee | employee_id unique per is_current=TRUE | Critical | Quarantine duplicate |
| DQ-005 | Referential | dim_employee | location_key EXISTS in dim_location | High | Quarantine record |
| DQ-006 | Referential | dim_employee | manager_employee_id EXISTS in employee set (or NULL for top-level) | High | Flag, allow through |
| DQ-007 | Range | fact_daily_staffing | patient_visits >= 0 | High | Quarantine record |
| DQ-008 | Range | fact_daily_staffing | coverage_score BETWEEN 0 AND 3.0 | Medium | Flag, allow through |
| DQ-009 | Range | fact_daily_staffing | overtime_hours >= 0 AND <= 24 | High | Quarantine record |
| DQ-010 | Consistency | dim_employee | IF status='Active' THEN termination_date IS NULL | High | Flag, allow through |
| DQ-011 | Consistency | dim_employee | IF status='Terminated' THEN termination_date IS NOT NULL | High | Flag, allow through |
| DQ-012 | Freshness | fact_daily_staffing | MAX(snapshot_date) within 2 days of CURRENT_DATE | Critical | Alert |
| DQ-013 | Volume | dim_employee | Row count within 10% of previous run | High | Alert |
| DQ-014 | Format | dim_employee | email LIKE '%@wellnow.com' | Low | Flag, allow through |
| DQ-015 | Cross-table | fact_daily_staffing | Every active location in dim_location has ≥1 staffing record per day | Medium | Alert |

### Quality Scoring

```
Overall DQ Score = (Critical Pass Rate × 0.40)
                 + (High Pass Rate × 0.30)
                 + (Medium Pass Rate × 0.20)
                 + (Low Pass Rate × 0.10)

Thresholds:
  ≥ 95%  → ✅ Healthy
  ≥ 85%  → ⚠️ Warning
  < 85%  → 🔴 Alert — pipeline may produce unreliable analytics
```

```

### File Structure Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Separation of concerns** | `src/api/`, `src/etl/`, `src/dashboard/` are independently deployable units |
| **Configuration externalized** | All config in `config/` or env vars; zero hardcoded secrets |
| **SQL version-controlled** | Numbered migration-style schema files in `sql/schema/` |
| **Tests co-located** | Each `src/` module has its own `tests/` directory |
| **Documentation first-class** | `docs/` is comprehensive; not an afterthought |
| **CI/CD ready** | `.github/workflows/` with lint + test + deploy pipelines |
| **Compliance artifacts** | `docs/security_and_compliance.md` documents HIPAA-relevant decisions |
| **Reproducible builds** | Pinned `requirements.txt`, lockfiles, Dockerfile with multi-stage build |

---

## 11. Security, Privacy & Compliance

This POC uses **100% synthetic data** — no real patient data, no real employee PII, no PHI. However, the architecture and code patterns are designed as if real data were flowing through the system, demonstrating awareness of healthcare compliance requirements.

### HIPAA Considerations (Demonstrated in Architecture)

| HIPAA Requirement | How POC Addresses It |
|---|---|
| **Minimum Necessary Rule** | API returns only fields required for analytics — no SSN, DOB, medical records |
| **Access Control** | API key authentication on every endpoint; IAM-based BigQuery access |
| **Audit Logging** | `_pipeline_runs` and `_data_quality_log` tables create a complete audit trail of every data access and transformation |
| **Encryption at Rest** | BigQuery and Cloud Storage encrypt at rest by default (Google-managed keys) |
| **Encryption in Transit** | All API calls over HTTPS; Cloud Run enforces TLS |
| **Data Retention** | Fact table partitioning enables time-based data lifecycle management |
| **Business Associate Agreement** | Noted as required for production (GCP provides BAA for healthcare customers) |

### Data Privacy Patterns (Demonstrated in Code)

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **No real PII in repository** | `.env.example` with placeholder values; `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, credentials, and data files |
| **Synthetic data only** | Faker-generated names, emails, IDs — clearly fictional |
| **Secret management** | API keys in environment variables; `setup_secrets.sh` documents Secret Manager pattern |
| **No credentials in code** | Zero hardcoded API keys, project IDs, or service account keys anywhere in source |
| **Quarantine pattern** | Invalid/suspicious records isolated in `_quarantine` table, not silently dropped or mixed into clean data |

### Additional Compliance Awareness

| Standard | Relevance | POC Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | TAG likely undergoes SOC 2 audits as a healthcare platform | Audit trail tables, access controls, change management via Git |
| **CCPA / State Privacy** | TAG operates in 48 states including California | Data minimization principle; no unnecessary PII fields |
| **EEOC / Pay Equity** | Relevant for future Use Case 3 (out of scope for v1) | Schema supports demographic fields for future equity analysis |
| **OSHA / Labor Law** | Overtime tracking and workload monitoring | Overtime rate and shift gap metrics support labor compliance monitoring |

### `.gitignore` Must-Haves

```gitignore
# Secrets — NEVER commit
.env
.env.local
.env.production
*.key
*.pem
service-account*.json
credentials*.json

# Data files — NEVER commit raw data
*.csv
*.json.gz

## 15. Out of Scope (v1)

### Deferred Use Cases

| Use Case | Priority Score | Rationale for Deferral | Recommended For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UC-1: Multi-Brand Clinician Retention & Attrition Intelligence** | 2.75 | High value but addresses workforce stability as a second-order effect. Requires cross-brand data model complexity that dilutes WellNow-specific focus. | **v2** |
| **UC-3: Compensation Competitiveness & Pay Equity Analytics** | 1.75 | Important for long-term talent strategy but minimal direct impact on patient-facing operations or per-location economics. Requires market benchmark data modeling. | **v3** |

### Deferred Technical Scope

- Real Workday / Cornerstone OnDemand integration (simulated instead)
- Real patient volume data or PHI of any kind
- User authentication / RBAC on the dashboard
- Real-time streaming (batch ETL is appropriate for daily staffing analytics cadence)
- dbt for transformations (raw Python demonstrates fundamentals more visibly)
- Terraform / IaC for infrastructure (shell scripts for POC simplicity)
- Multi-environment setup (dev / staging / prod)
- Row-level security in BigQuery
- ML-based demand forecasting for patient volume prediction
- Real-time alerting (Cloud Monitoring → PagerDuty/Slack)
- API rate limiting beyond simple API key auth
- CultureAmp or employee engagement survey integration
- Multi-brand cross-portfolio reporting (v1 is WellNow-only focus)

## 16. Claude Code Implementation Instructions

This section provides structured instructions for using Claude Code to implement this POC. The PRD must be provided as project context at the start of each Claude Code session.

---

### STEP 0: Architecture Design Phase (MANDATORY — Run Before Any Code)

> **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** Claude Code must complete the full architecture design phase before writing any application logic. This ensures design coherence across all components and prevents rework.

```
PROMPT — ARCHITECTURE DESIGN (START HERE):

You are implementing a People Analytics pipeline POC for WellNow Urgent Care
staffing optimization. The full PRD is available in this project's context
(PRD_People_Analytics_Healthcare_TAG.md).

BEFORE writing any application code, complete these architecture deliverables:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 0A: Read & Internalize the PRD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Read Sections 1-15 of the PRD thoroughly. Confirm you understand:
- The business problem (Section 3)
- All 8 KPIs and their definitions
- The full BigQuery schema (Section 7) — every table, every field
- All 15 DQ rules (Section 8)
- The 3 showcase SQL queries
- The dashboard specification (Section 9)
- The file structure (Section 10)
- The compliance requirements (Section 11)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 0B: Create the Full Repository Structure
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Create EVERY directory, __init__.py, and .gitkeep file exactly as specified
in Section 10. Also create:
- .gitignore (from Section 11)
- .env.example with all required environment variables (placeholder values)
- Makefile with targets: setup, test, lint, deploy-api, deploy-etl, deploy-dashboard
- LICENSE (MIT)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (basic template)
- CHANGELOG.md (v0.1.0 — initial structure)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 0C: Write Architecture Documentation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Create these docs BEFORE any application code:

1. docs/architecture.md
   - System architecture with Mermaid diagram
   - Component interaction: API → ETL → BigQuery → Dashboard
   - Data flow: source → staging → warehouse → dashboard JSON
   - Technology choices with rationale for each
   - Deployment topology (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Vercel)
   - Error handling strategy (retries, quarantine, alerting)
   - What would change at TAG's scale (1,400 locations vs. 80)

2. docs/data_dictionary.md
   - Every table, every field: name, type, nullable, description, example
   - Business definition for every derived field
   - Source system origin for every raw field

3. docs/data_lineage.md
   - API endpoint → raw staging → BigQuery table → dashboard JSON
   - Every derived field: formula, input fields, transformation logic
   - Data freshness expectations per table

4. docs/security_and_compliance.md
   - Synthetic data declaration
   - Authentication patterns (API key, IAM)
   - Secret management approach (.env → Secret Manager for prod)
   - Audit trail design (_pipeline_runs, _dq_log)
   - HIPAA considerations (documented even though synthetic)
   - What changes for production with real PHI/PII

5. docs/api_specification.md
   - Every endpoint: method, path, params, response schema, examples
   - Authentication details
   - Error response format
   - Pagination spec

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 0D: Create BigQuery Schema Files
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Create all SQL files in sql/schema/ (001-009) exactly as specified in
Section 7 of the PRD. Also create:
- sql/seed/seed_dim_date.sql (2 years: 2025-01-01 to 2026-12-31)
- sql/queries/ — all 3 showcase queries from Section 7

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 0E: Create config/quality_rules.yaml
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Externalize all 15 DQ rules from Section 8 into a YAML file that the
ETL validate.py module will read. Each rule should have:
- rule_id, check_type, table_name, rule_definition, severity, action

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 0F: Architecture Review Checklist
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Before proceeding to Phase 1, verify:
□ Can api/, etl/, dashboard/ each be deployed independently?
□ Are there ANY hardcoded values that should be in config/env vars?
□ Is every secret in .env.example (not in source code)?
□ Does .gitignore cover all sensitive files?
□ Would a reviewer understand the entire project from README + docs/?
□ Do all SQL files parse correctly?
□ Does quality_rules.yaml contain all 15 rules?

Confirm completion of Step 0 before proceeding to Phase 1.
```

### STEP 1: Foundation — Simulated HRIS API (Phase 1)

```
PROMPT — PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION:

Architecture design is complete. Now implement Phase 1 per the PRD:

Build the FastAPI application in src/api/:

1. main.py — FastAPI app with:
   - CORS middleware
   - Request/response logging middleware
   - Global exception handler with structured error responses
   - API version prefix (/api/v1)

2. auth.py — API key middleware:
   - Read key from HRIS_API_KEY env var
   - Validate X-API-Key header on every request except /health
   - Return 401 with structured error if invalid

3. config.py — Environment-based configuration:
   - All settings from env vars with sensible defaults
   - Pydantic Settings class for validation

4. Routers (src/api/routers/) — Each endpoint per Section 5:
   - workers.py: paginated list + single detail
   - schedules.py: date range + location filtered
   - patient_volume.py: date range + location filtered
   - locations.py: full location list
   - terminations.py: date range filtered
   - health.py: readiness check

5. Models (src/api/models/) — Pydantic v2 strict mode:
   - employee.py: EmployeeResponse, EmployeeListResponse
   - schedule.py: ShiftRecord, ScheduleResponse
   - patient_volume.py: DailyVolumeRecord, VolumeResponse
   - location.py: LocationResponse
   - common.py: PaginationMeta, ErrorResponse, APIKeyHeader

6. Generators (src/api/generators/) — CRITICAL for realism:
   - seed.py: MASTER_SEED = 42, deterministic Faker instances
   - organization.py: 80 locations across 15 states
     * Follow WellNow's geographic footprint: Northeast + Midwest heavy
     * Mix of Urban (40%), Suburban (45%), Rural (15%)
     * Each location has budgeted FTEs based on type
   - employee_generator.py: ~1,200 employees
     * Role distribution: 20% Provider, 15% RN, 25% MA, 10% RadTech,
       10% OfficeMgr, 20% FrontDesk
     * Tenure: right-skewed distribution (many new, few very long)
     * Attrition: 22% support, 12% provider annual rates
   - schedule_generator.py: 18 months of daily shift data
     * 3 shifts per location per day (AM/PM/Evening)
     * Seasonal patient demand patterns
     * Realistic callout rates (5-8%), higher on weekends
     * Overtime clustered at chronically understaffed locations
   - patient_volume_generator.py: correlated with season + staffing
     * Winter peaks (Nov-Feb), summer troughs (Jun-Aug)
     * Monday + Saturday peaks for urgent care
     * Urban > Suburban > Rural volumes
   - termination_generator.py: exit events with reason distribution

7. Tests (src/api/tests/):
   - test_generators.py: verify distributions, referential integrity,
     reproducibility across runs
   - test_api_*.py: endpoint response schemas, pagination, filtering
   - test_auth.py: valid key, invalid key, missing key

8. Dockerfile — Multi-stage build:
   - Stage 1: builder (install deps)
   - Stage 2: runtime (slim image, non-root user)
   - HEALTHCHECK instruction

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Type hints on EVERY function parameter and return value
- Docstrings on EVERY public function, class, and module
- No hardcoded values — everything from config.py
- Structured JSON logging via utils
- All Pydantic models in strict mode
```

### STEP 2: ETL Pipeline (Phase 2)

```
PROMPT — PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTATION:

API is working. Now build the ETL pipeline in src/etl/ per PRD Section 6:

1. main.py — Cloud Function HTTP entry point
2. pipeline.py — Orchestrator with run_id, stage tracking, metadata logging
3. extract.py — Paginated API calls with exponential backoff (utils/retry.py)
4. validate.py — All 15 DQ rules loaded from config/quality_rules.yaml
5. transform.py — All derived fields from Section 6 Stage 3
6. load.py — BigQuery load jobs, TRUNCATE dims / APPEND facts
7. export_dashboard_data.py — Run showcase queries, export JSON to GCS
8. config/settings.py — Load pipeline.yaml with env var interpolation
9. models/schemas.py — Pydantic validation schemas for each data entity
10. utils/ — logger.py, retry.py, metrics.py, gcp.py

Test the full pipeline locally: python -m src.etl.pipeline
Verify all BigQuery tables populated and _pipeline_runs shows Success.
```

### STEP 3: Dashboard (Phase 3)

```
PROMPT — PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION:

Pipeline is running. Build the React dashboard in src/dashboard/ per Section 9:

1. Scaffold: Vite + React 18 + Tailwind CSS + React Router v6 + Recharts
2. All 6 pages as specified in Section 9
3. StaffingDashboard.jsx is the PRIMARY page — it must be exceptional:
   - 6 KPI cards with trend indicators
   - 5 visualizations (map, heatmap, trend lines, waterfall, table)
   - 3 interactive filters (date range, region, location type)
4. Professional healthcare-appropriate color palette
5. Mobile responsive (tablet-friendly for field ops)
6. Sample JSON data in public/data/ for development
7. Deploy to Vercel

DESIGN: Clean, professional, data-dense but not cluttered. Think
Tableau/PowerBI dashboard quality, not a toy demo.
```

### STEP 4: Polish & Ship (Phase 4)

```
PROMPT — PHASE 4 POLISH:

Everything works. Now make it portfolio-ready:

1. README.md — First impression for hiring managers:
   - Architecture diagram (Mermaid)
   - Live demo link
   - Tech stack badges
   - Quickstart guide
   - Key design decisions
   - Skills demonstrated
   - Cost: $0/month
   - Author: Kriti Srivastava

2. Complete remaining docs/ files
3. CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml (ruff + pytest + eslint + vite build)
4. Code quality: docstrings, type hints, no TODOs, no commented code
5. Lighthouse performance >90
6. CHANGELOG.md: v1.0.0
```
